Just Enough Flexibility
-----------------------

A content management system has to decide the level of flexibility it allows. Usually, more flexibility is better.

But in the case of IITG, there is a subtle difference. The various people involved with the Technical Board activities change every year. Over the course of four years, the people change completely.

In this situation, more flexibility leads to drastic change, which consequently leads to a broken website. Thus, the architecture provides *just enough flexibility* to the editors. In some sense, this is similar to `defensive design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_design>`_.
